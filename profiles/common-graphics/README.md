# Common graphics source packages

This opt-in source profile prepares canonical MesaLib 26.2.4nb1, adapted
libdrm 2.4.134nb1, Wayland 1.26.0nb1 and wayland-protocols 1.49 for
NetBSD 11/AArch64. Native builds and the explicit
[macOS cross composition](cross/profile.md) consume the existing
[common build tools](../common-build-tools/README.md): GCC16, Python3.14.8,
Meson1.12.1 and shared LLVM23.1.2 remain one dependency graph with final
`LOCALBASE=PREFIX=/usr/pkg`. Plasma Mobile uses this exact graphics layer.
The default, development-toolchain and common-build-tools exports keep their
original graphics recipes. The whole installed graphics stack and a Mobile
demonstration still require acceptance; individual package results follow.

The [graphics cross-build](cross/README.md) now builds the complete selected
libdrm payload on macOS with GCC16. All 26 staged entries match PLIST, and
hash, drmsl and symbol checks pass in AArch64 UTM. Device enumeration is
skipped on the current framebuffer-only kernel. Its normal libdrm package
and wayland-protocols package now also build and install into the cross sysroot.
Installed libdrm passes hash, drmsl and symbol checks on Zero 3W, resolving
the exact packaged library without loader overrides. Device enumeration
returns 77 on its framebuffer-only kernel; see the [repeat commands](cross/README.md).

The full [installed Mesa package](cross/mesa-package.md) passes four EGL/GLES
shader and pixel lifecycles through llvmpipe/LLVM23 on Zero 3W, reporting
EGL 1.5 and GLES 3.2. All 37 upstream test invocations exit zero; utility
tests report one internal skip and NIR nine disabled cases. Downstream
consumer migration and visible X11/Wayland sessions remain separate gates.

The [Wayland 1.26.0nb1 package](cross/wayland.md) passes all 26 enabled
upstream invocations on Zero 3W with the paired kernel IPC fixes. The common
[LLVM23 core](../common-build-tools/llvm-family.md) passes installed C API and
four default ORC JITLink lifecycles on that board. These results establish
library/runtime prerequisites, not a compositor or accelerated renderer.

The same cross directory contains a temporary Mesa26 headless diagnostic.
Its private softpipe bundle passed shader rejection, triangle pixels, four
EGL lifecycles and 30 selected upstream test runs on Orange Pi Zero 3W (A733).
That result excludes LLVM/llvmpipe, X11/Wayland and installed packages.

The selected APIs are X11/Wayland, EGL, GBM, OpenGL and GLES; renderers are
classic VirGL, softpipe and llvmpipe with ORC JIT. The recipe requires shared
LLVM23, upstream tests and portable TLS. It never substitutes Mesa21,
libLLVM13, another Python or native X11 GL/EGL/DRM/GLU providers. Native X11
protocol libraries can still satisfy pkgsrc's actual version checks.

## Prepare and select

```sh
sh scripts/prepare-pkgsrc.sh /absolute/new-pkgsrc common-graphics
# Plasma also replaces the current Qt/KF toolkit recipes:
sh scripts/prepare-pkgsrc.sh /absolute/another-new-pkgsrc plasma-mobile
```

Include the exported files in a private native MAKECONF, in this order:

```make
.include "/absolute/prepared-pkgsrc/EMBERBSD-COMMON-TOOLS-MK.CONF"
.include "/absolute/prepared-pkgsrc/EMBERBSD-COMMON-GRAPHICS-MK.CONF"
# For Plasma, include media before the toolkit:
.include "/absolute/prepared-pkgsrc/EMBERBSD-COMMON-MEDIA-MK.CONF"
.include "/absolute/prepared-pkgsrc/EMBERBSD-PLASMA-TOOLKIT-MK.CONF"
```

The exporter validates all six source pins, complete recipe trees and exact
RCS-filtered patch hashes before creating its destination. It replaces
`graphics/MesaLib`, `x11/libdrm`, `devel/wayland` and
`devel/wayland-protocols`, `x11/xorgproto` and `devel/libudev-bsd`
inside the new pinned pkgsrc export.
`EMBERBSD-COMMON-GRAPHICS-SOURCES` records their provenance. Unknown modes,
existing destinations and category collisions remain errors. No system
configuration or installed package is changed by preparation.

The [Wayland cross instructions](cross/wayland.md) build the matching host
scanner and run the enabled upstream suite against the installed target
libraries. NetBSD adaptations use real peer credentials and descriptor
counts; they retain upstream leak checks and test failures.

GCC selection belongs to the included common-tools configuration, including
the complete compiler package's runtime policy and native bootstrap boundary.
The graphics profile adds no second compiler policy.

The profile rejects conflicting command-line providers, dependency minima,
Meson overrides, old/unprepared recipes, cross builds without the dedicated
opt-in, another platform or prefix. Mesa substitutes one absolute common
`TOOL_PYTHONBIN` into upstream's
actual interpreter list, preserving version and Mako/packaging/PyYAML checks.
Failed imports cannot select another interpreter. LLVM's explicit absolute
`LLVM_CONFIG_PATH` reaches Meson's native or cross machine file; production
pre-configure checks reject missing metadata, another version, static-only
LLVM or missing ORC components/RTTI. There are no fallback downloads.
Cross builds additionally require the real target-metadata helper and verify
its receipt and target sysroot paths before configuration.

The build-tool layer supplies Mako 1.4.3, MarkupSafe 3.0.4 and PyYAML
6.0.3nb1. Native generator checks use the installed packages. PyYAML requires
Cython 3.3 and libyaml; its real extension is packaged and the upstream suite
passes with its documented skips. Xorgproto 2026.1 and libudev-bsd 0.7.0.1
complete the current graphics dependency recipes.

## Bounded package contents

Mesa enables zlib/zstd and the NetBSD libudev-bsd provider. Display-info,
libunwind, valgrind, Vulkan, video frontends, Rusticl/OpenCL, physical drivers,
OSMesa, XA and GLVND are outside this candidate. Requests for unsupported
Mesa options fail; they do not install older providers. Unselected optional
libelf/Lua/XCB-keysyms are absent from the buildlink sandbox.

libdrm is deliberately core-only. Intel, Radeon, AMDGPU, Nouveau, VMware and
physical ARM client modules, man pages and test-program installation are
disabled; upstream tests remain enabled. Unconditional kernel UAPI headers
remain installed. A consumer requiring `libdrm_amdgpu`, `libdrm_intel` or
another disabled client module is a migration blocker. Adapted revision
`nb1` prevents an unpatched libdrm2.4.134 package satisfying the native
identity requirement. The canonical recipe omits pkgsrc's native-X11
avoid-duplicate skip, so actual dependency selection still builds libdrm.

Both Mesa and libdrm PLISTs match their complete cross-staged payloads and
pass normal package checks. Mesa's installed CPU rendering and upstream
tests pass the separate [target acceptance](cross/mesa-package.md).
Mesa's GL/EGL/
GLES/GBM/DRM SONAME closure is GL1/EGL1/GLESv1_CM1/GLESv2 2/GBM1/DRM2,
plus `libgallium-26.2.4.so`, the GBM backend and upstream dril driver links.
`glx.pc`, `eglext_angle.h`, `gbm_backend_abi.h` and both upstream drirc
configuration defaults are included. Defaults remain in `share/drirc.d`;
an existing user drirc must be preserved independently. OSMesa/XA, video,
physical aliases and the old shared libglapi files are removed from PLIST.
Mesa26 shared-glapi is private/static within gallium, with no replacement DSO.

Normal same-pkgbase upgrade handles old Mesa-owned files. Separate installed
`libglapi`/`libglvnd` providers conflict explicitly; these are package-database
conflicts, not invented recipes in this pkgsrc pin. Never delete base X11
files or fabricate SONAME links. Native transition requires an ownership and
reverse-dependency inventory and actual rebuild of GLU, libepoxy, Qt/KF,
compositor and all installed/dynamically loaded graphics consumers.

## Provenance and verification

The recipe base is pkgsrc `fff4deb639a1a640476203c80f752fb77b6cb14b`.
[sources.tsv](sources.tsv) records original URLs and SHA256; distinfo also
records BLAKE2s, SHA512, size and filtered patch SHA1. Original RCS identifiers,
ownership and licences are retained. Local work is AI-assisted and has not
been submitted or accepted upstream.

The four exact accepted Mesa patches and the complete 44-patch disposition
belong to [the source probe](../../probes/wayland-utm/mesa-patches.md).
The package additionally selects the explicit build-host Python and groups
compound-literal arguments in six colour-matrix copies for NetBSD's fortified
`memcpy` macro. The latter preserves the matrix values and SSP checks; it is
covered by an actual GCC16/NetBSD-header compile regression.
All seven imported libdrm patches plus the three accepted symbol/identity/
strict-warning patches remain byte-identical to
[their owner](../../probes/wayland-utm/native-identity.md). Disabled-module
patch hunks remain for provenance; their presence does not imply those modules
were built. The only unsupported-bus warning exception remains the narrow
`-Wno-error=cpp` used by the accepted strict-warning adaptation.

Run lightweight source checks with existing BSD make, Ruby, a C compiler,
OpenSSL with BLAKE2s, shasum, tar and patch:

```sh
sh profiles/common-graphics/tests/source.sh VERIFIED_DISTFILES NEW_WORK
sh profiles/common-graphics/tests/export.sh NEW_WORK
sh profiles/common-graphics/tests/mesa-bundle-integrity.sh NEW_WORK
BMAKE=/absolute/bmake sh profiles/common-graphics/tests/profile.sh EXPORTED_PKGSRC NEW_WORK

BMAKE=/absolute/bmake sh profiles/common-graphics/tests/selection.sh \

TEST_PYTHON=/absolute/host-python3.14 TEST_MESON=/absolute/meson-1.12.1/meson.py \
BMAKE=/absolute/bmake ruby profiles/common-graphics/tests/configuration.rb \
    PATCHED_MESA NEW_WORK
```

For the final command, supply verified upstream Mako/MarkupSafe source paths,
packaging and PyYAML through `PYTHONPATH` when the host lacks them. No helper
installs packages. Its actual Meson fragment executes production interpreter
selection and upstream option declarations. Production recipe LLVM guards
use explicit metadata fixtures. Full-recipe selection executes pkgsrc's real
builtin/buildlink/dependency logic, using the exact pinned pkgtools dewey
matcher with narrow host header glue and declared target/installed-option
metadata. These host checks are not native Mesa configuration or compilation.
They retain host-only dlopen/license premises as failures, not fake success.
Upstream megadriver installation executes against dummy staging to verify
real relative link targets and master retention; it is not native staging.

Accepted lifetime/half-float/libdrm-identity contracts are referenced, not
rerun as package evidence. The new checks cover archive/patch integrity,
zero-fuzz once-only applications, import/tool failures, provider/version
selection, export composition and temporary-archive failure cleanup.

## Target package and consumer acceptance remain mandatory

The common LLVM23 runtime and complete Mesa26 cross package now pass target
API, normal packaging and installed CPU-rendering checks. Mesa's cross build
also passes eight host source/ELF tests. Repeat the installed tests with the
[package runner](cross/mesa-package.md) and verify package ownership.
Normal `check-files`, shared-library/RPATH/WRKREF and installed pkg_admin checks
remain required for subsequent rebuilds. No skip list exempts a file.

Then rebuild and inspect affected consumers, including loaded dril/GBM/Qt
plugins: exactly one Mesa/DRM/sharedLLVM/GCC16 runtime, no libglapi, old base
GL3/EGL0/DRM3, build paths or loader overrides. NetBSD clients loading worker
libraries need pthread at process startup. Consumer graphics checks,
matched-kernel KMS/input identity and VirGL sessions remain runtime gates.
The [common media profile](../common-media/README.md) prepares FFmpeg9 for
Qt Multimedia/KFileMetadata; native packages and playback remain unaccepted.
Physical GPU acceleration and the complete Mobile workflow remain unverified.
