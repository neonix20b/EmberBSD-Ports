# Shared Rust 1.99 build-host provider

The common profiles export `lang/rust-bin` 1.99.0nb1 for the build-host compiler
needed by current cargo-c and librsvg. The archive is the official Rust release;
this step does not compile another rustc or LLVM. Native and target components
remain distinct: a macOS compiler needs a compatible NetBSD target std before
it can build NetBSD Rust consumers.

## Recipe provenance and adaptation

The binary recipe is based on pinned pkgsrc
`fff4deb639a1a640476203c80f752fb77b6cb14b` and
[pkgsrc-wip rust199-bin at 7d3133f](https://github.com/NetBSD/pkgsrc-wip/tree/7d3133f21d6d918d9f2e62b708f3583c40120343/rust199-bin).
The upstream installer is unchanged. `distinfo` preserves the published
BLAKE2s/SHA512 checksums and sizes; the tested Apple Silicon archive has an
additional official SHA256 pin in [sources.tsv](sources.tsv).
The recipe does not advertise NetBSD i386/mipsel or SunOS, for which this
import has no active archive selection and matching checksum.

Revision nb1 preserves upstream Mach-O install names and loader-relative
paths on Darwin. The inherited post-install script expands `@rpath` into an
absolute package prefix; this can exceed a prebuilt library's available load
command space. A real package build reported that error for libstd but still
created a package, because the shell loop lost the tool's error status.
The relative layout already works from the upstream component installation.
Non-Darwin `patchelf` behavior is retained.

The recipe also opts into `MACHO_USE_LOAD_COMMANDS=yes` in the exported pkgsrc
infrastructure. The old `otool -L` metadata includes a dylib's own install ID
and leaves `@rpath` unresolved. Consequently `pkg_add` rejects an otherwise
working staged Rust installation as missing its own libraries.
The opt-in checker reads actual imports with `otool -l`, separately for each
architecture, and resolves the image's local runpaths in order. A candidate
must exist and contain the importing architecture. The same code supplies
both package requirements and explicit shared-library checks. Staged providers
remain package-owned; external pkgsrc providers must be runtime dependencies.
The default checker remains unchanged for recipes that do not opt in.

This static check does not reconstruct inherited loader runpath chains.
Unresolved paths fail explicitly. It covers the official Rust distribution's
own runpaths, including its universal sanitizer libraries. The ordering follows
[Apple's runpath documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/DynamicLibraries/100-Articles/RunpathDependentLibraries.html).

This is an EmberBSD adaptation with AI assistance, not an upstream-accepted
change. Re-evaluate it when the upstream recipe changes. The correction does
not rely on invalid code signatures: both the original and rewritten rustc
passed the observed signature check. The reproduced problem is load-command
overflow and unnecessary rewriting of a working relative layout.

## Build and verify

Prepare a common profile with [the normal exporter](README.md#prepare-and-select).
Use the existing native macOS pkgsrc configuration and shared host prefix,
with a separate work directory and the verified distfile cache. Do not include
the native NetBSD compiler-selection profile in this host build.

```sh
MAKECONF=/absolute/native-mk.conf bmake -C /absolute/pkgsrc/lang/rust-bin \
  WRKOBJDIR=/absolute/work DISTDIR=/absolute/distfiles MAKE_JOBS=2 \
  CHECK_SHLIBS=yes package
```

Keep normal pkgsrc checks enabled. For post-install changes, use a clean
staging directory: this recipe intentionally removes installer manifests after
staging, so invoking upstream's install script over that previous staging tree
cannot uninstall its old components. Preserve the failing log and package.
A package revision change can also invalidate pkgsrc's existing work state.
When changing pkgsrc infrastructure in a retained work tree, invalidate its
cached `+BUILD_INFO` and `+BUILD_VERSION` before packaging again. `repackage`
alone can retain those old records. Inspect both the package metadata and a
normal installation; a successful staged compiler alone is insufficient.

Run the regression against a verified upstream component installation and the
new package's staged prefix before installing it:

```sh
ruby tests/rust-darwin.rb /absolute/original-rust \
  /absolute/staged-prefix /absolute/new-check
```

The check compares the exact bytes of rustc, cargo, the rustc driver, its LLVM
library and host libstd. It reproduces the old install-name overflow on a
disposable real library. The staged compiler then builds and runs a native
allocation/thread/TLS/unwind consumer, with no dynamic-loader override.
Cargo's version is checked too. This does not validate every extra tool in the
full upstream distribution or any non-Darwin platform.

Run the Mach-O regression on macOS with the exported pkgsrc tree:

```sh
ruby tests/macho-load-commands.rb /absolute/pkgsrc /absolute/new-macho-check
```

It builds and runs real consumers, checks self-ID exclusion, universal images,
bare and relative loader/executable paths, and the architecture fallback order.
Missing libraries/runpaths, wrong-architecture providers, build-directory
references and undeclared or build-only package owners must be diagnosed.
The dependency-owner fixture uses a controlled pkg_info response; it does not
register fake packages. The legacy resolver remains a causal negative control.

On macOS/Apple Silicon, `rust-bin-1.99.0nb1` passes a normal package build with
`CHECK_SHLIBS=yes`, ordinary installation, and the installed five-provider
byte/native-runtime check. Both generated package archives contain the newly
resolved metadata. All six export modes pass composition checks, including
refusal when the Mach-O infrastructure patch is absent. This validates the
build-host compiler; it is not an installed NetBSD compiler package.

Use normal `bmake install` after acceptance. Native Rust consumers explicitly
select `RUST_TYPE=bin`; otherwise the pinned pkgsrc tree defaults to its older
source compiler. Do not install a separate compiler for cargo-c or librsvg.
The existing `devel/cargo-c` 0.10.25 recipe supplies its checksummed crate closure
and uses the installed host OpenSSL provider.

It builds and installs with the shared Rust on macOS/Apple Silicon, with
`CHECK_SHLIBS=yes` and OpenSSL 3.6.4nb1. The source archive does not ship
Cargo.lock; the offline build resolves only the recipe's pinned vendored crates.
Use the same native MAKECONF and separate work directory:

```sh
MAKECONF=/absolute/native-mk.conf bmake -C /absolute/pkgsrc/devel/cargo-c \
  WRKOBJDIR=/absolute/work DISTDIR=/absolute/distfiles MAKE_JOBS=2 \
  RUST_TYPE=bin CHECK_SHLIBS=yes install
ruby tests/cargo-c.rb /absolute/host-prefix /absolute/new-cargo-check
```

The offline consumer runs cbuild, ctest and cinstall, generates a C header and
pkg-config record, executes one Rust unit test, and links/runs a C consumer.
Its load commands must name the installed test library; the build-host
providers remain unchanged. This is native build-tool acceptance, not target
librsvg or target std package acceptance.

## NetBSD target boundary

The official compiler's private LLVM 23.1.1 backend is part of this upstream
binary distribution. It is not the target shared LLVM 23.1.2 provider used by
Mesa and is not rebuilt here.

The [target std package](rust-target-std.md) now installs the same-compiler
source build into this shared host sysroot. Normal package integrity and
AArch64 VM consumers pass TLS, unwind, C `dlopen`, and a Cargo target built
with a macOS proc macro and build script. Host Rust/LLVM bytes are unchanged.
Full librsvg/GIR/pixbuf, labwc surfaces/input/VT and an installed NetBSD
compiler remain separate acceptance steps.
