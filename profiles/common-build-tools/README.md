# Current common build tools

This profile prepares one common Python 3.14.8, Meson 1.12.1 and matching
LLVM/Clang/LLD 23.1.2 with upstream lit for the
GCC 16 / LLVM 23 / Mesa 26 dependency closure. The [Python package](python.md)
cross-builds on macOS and passes installed AArch64 VM consumers and 21 selected
upstream suites. Meson/Ninja also pass installed C/C++ consumers and focused
upstream tests in that VM. The installed LLVM core and
[Mesa consumers](../common-graphics/cross/mesa-package.md) also pass runtime
acceptance; Clang/LLD packages remain separate gates. The export itself installs no packages.

The shared [Rust 1.99 host package](rust.md) preserves upstream macOS binaries
and repairs Mach-O dependency resolution for cargo-c/librsvg builds. Its
[accepted target std](../../probes/rust-cross-std/README.md) still needs normal packaging.

The [macOS cross-package path](cross/README.md) uses GCC16 and ordinary pkgsrc
packaging. Pkgconf 3.0.7, GNU M4 1.4.21, Libtool 2.6.2 and
[Binutils 2.47nb1](binutils.md) pass package checks
and [installed AArch64 VM acceptance](cross/validation.md). Cross package
metadata, alternate-root updates and target script paths have regressions.
Binutils includes a tested DWARF32/64 line-table repair. Its acceptance
explicitly selects GNU as/ld; migration of the bootstrap GCC16 package's
hardcoded base-tool paths remains pending.

The profile owns full Python, Meson and
[LLVM family recipes](llvm-family.md), based on
pkgsrc `fff4deb639a1a640476203c80f752fb77b6cb14b`. It composes the established
[development toolchain](../development-toolchain/README.md) export without
changing GCC bootstrap options. The common MAKECONF selects
the prepared GCC16 package for new native builds. LLVM family recipes also
prepare scoped native Clang defaults. The default
export and `development-toolchain` mode retain their previous behavior.

The [common graphics profile](../common-graphics/README.md) composes these
tools with canonical MesaLib/libdrm source recipes. It does not change this
profile's exported package set or establish an installed graphics stack.

This MAKECONF selects an installed native target compiler. For compilation
on macOS, use the [cross-package configuration](cross/README.md) with the
[GCC16 cross recipe](../development-toolchain/cross/README.md). Its host tools
and target sysroot are separate from this native pkgsrc selection policy.

## Prepare and select

```sh
git submodule update --init --depth 1 upstream/pkgsrc
sh scripts/prepare-pkgsrc.sh /absolute/new-pkgsrc common-build-tools
```

The destination must be new. The exporter rejects missing required patches
before creating it. Original archive URLs and SHA256 are in
[sources.tsv](sources.tsv); recipes record BLAKE2s, SHA512, size and pkgsrc's
RCS-filtered patch SHA1. Meson uses its release asset, not GitHub's generated
source tarball. No archives, build outputs or local machine settings belong
in Git.

A later native build's private MAKECONF includes the exported
`EMBERBSD-COMMON-TOOLS-MK.CONF`. Include `EMBERBSD-DEVELOPMENT-MK.CONF` only
when its documented C/C++ options are also intended. The common-tools file
requires Python 314, Meson >=1.12.1 and pkgsrc GCC for native NetBSD 11/AArch64,
with final `LOCALBASE=PREFIX=/usr/pkg` and one worker. It sets `GCC_REQD+=16.2`,
`PKGSRC_COMPILER=gcc`, `USE_PKGSRC_GCC=yes` and `USE_NATIVE_GCC=no`.
`GCC_REQD` is a major.minor floor, not an exact installed-version check;
the prepared recipe supplies `gcc16-16.2.0nb1`. The standard
`BUILDLINK_API_DEPENDS.gcc16+=gcc16>=16.2.0nb1` dependency requires the
[C++ modules allocation repair](../development-toolchain/modules-portability.md). The pinned pkgsrc comparison
cannot handle `GCC_REQD=16.2.0`; use `16.2`. Compatible command-line floors
and `ccache gcc` / `distcc gcc` chains remain supported. Incompatible compiler,
native-compiler, runtime and dependency-method overrides fail explicitly.

The complete compiler package must already be bootstrapped with
`EMBERBSD-DEVELOPMENT-MK.CONF` and native GCC12. Do not include common tools
while building GCC16 or its bootstrap closure. After installation, include
common tools for new consumers; pkgsrc obtains `/usr/pkg/gcc16` from the
installed package's file metadata. Missing metadata retains the normal GCC16
dependency and does not prove a compiler executable exists.

The package includes its own runtime through `always-libgcc`.
`BUILDLINK_DEPMETHOD.gcc16=full` keeps that complete package as a consumer
runtime dependency, including C-only consumers. The public
`.MAKEFLAGS: USE_PKGSRC_GCC_RUNTIME=no` setting is intentional: pinned
`gcc.mk` otherwise forces this knob to `yes` on NetBSD, adding a separate
`gcc16-libs` dependency and custom runtime specs. Here the selected driver
and pkgsrc RPATH select the complete package's own runtime. `no` disables
that separate provider; it does not select the base GCC12 runtime.
Native compile/link/runtime checks must verify the actual loaded libraries.
The original [native selection fixture](tests/native-compiler-selection/README.md) passes
on physical Orange Pi Zero 3W: actual pkgsrc wrappers compile and package C/C++,
and the installed consumer loads the selected GCC16 runtime. The updated
fixture passes with installed nb1 through the durable
`/etc/mk.conf` default on the same board. The
[compiler validation](../development-toolchain/native-validation.md) records
current math dependencies, focused LTO checks and remaining compiler limits.
The [reversible development defaults](development-defaults.md) now select
installed nb1 in fresh login/SSH sessions and ordinary pkgsrc builds on that
board. The durable common include is copied from this committed profile.
Base `/usr/bin/cc` remains available through the explicit private bootstrap
configuration. Existing GUI consumer migration and fresh-image acceptance
remain separate gates.

The opt-in `lang/python/pyversion.mk` guard rejects unsupported consumers
and older command-line interpreter overrides. Repair those consumers through
Ports; do not select an old interpreter or install another one beside this
stack. This source stage does not install those interpreter packages. Later
package migration must check their reverse dependencies.

Run the focused metadata gate against a prepared common-media export:

```sh
BMAKE=/absolute/bmake sh profiles/common-build-tools/tests/compiler-selection.sh \
    EXPORTED_PKGSRC NEW_WORK
```

It executes complete pinned pkgsrc compiler/buildlink/dependency metadata
with declared target and installed-package receipts. It checks ordinary C/C++
consumers, LLVM/graphics/media composition, policy overrides and native GCC12
bootstrap boundaries. It does not execute a target compiler or accept native
packages. Missing BSD make fails this gate.

Use the separate native fixture after installing the documented prerequisites;
it exercises real target compilation and removes only its own test package.

## Patch decisions

Original pkgsrc identifiers, ownership and upstream licenses are preserved.
Local adaptations and shell/C contracts are AI-assisted EmberBSD work;
these adaptations have not been submitted or accepted upstream.

| Python patch | Decision and reason |
| --- | --- |
| `Include_pymacro.h` | Retain NetBSD/SunOS constant-expression assertion. |
| `Lib___pyrepl_terminfo.py` | Retain NetBSD terminfo.cdb via ctypes and tmux alias. |
| `Lib_ctypes_util.py` | Retain PREFIX/X11 clang search and conditional SunOS lookup. |
| `Lib_sysconfig_____init____.py` | Retain coupled platform-only sysconfig and config-directory naming. |
| `Makefile.pre.in` | Retain install ordering, optimization levels 0/1, naming and suppression of generic libpython3.so; correct the policy description. |
| `Modules_faulthandler.c` | Drop the inherited manual-count workaround after eight actual native GCC16 initializer variants and pointer rejection pass; retain the upstream array-derived count. |
| `Modules_readline.c` | Retain selected readline portability; editline is not accepted here. |
| `Modules_socketmodule.c` | Retain conditional SunOS declaration. |
| `Misc_python-config.in` | Include the shared-library search directory for installed embedding, matching the shell script. |
| `Lib_test_test__sysconfig.py` | Check retained pkgsrc `.so` naming and actual loader acceptance on NetBSD; keep tagged-priority coverage. |
| `configure` / `configure.ac` | Retain packaging/UUID hunks; recognize NetBSD/AArch64 in both cross-host checks, preserving unknown-host rejection. |
| `Tools_build_generate-build-details.py` | Describe the target NetBSD platform, version, ABI, loader suffixes and installed static library. |

The Python PLIST adds the two upstream test modules `test_capi/test_slice`
and `test_free_threading/test_context`, each with source and optimization
levels 0/1, and removes the obsolete `idle_test/test_zzdummy_user` entries.
Buildlink's config directory matches the installed
`config-3.14` directory. No generic libpython SONAME alias is created.
The recipe uses upstream's shipped `configure`, without autoreconf;
the new cross-host cases are also maintained in `configure.ac`. Regeneration
of the inherited pkgsrc changes still needs a separate synchronized review.
The [Python cross recipe](python.md) explains the host interpreter, OpenSSL
sysroot and installed metadata adaptations. NetBSD still selects pkgsrc libuuid instead
of its system's UUIDv4-only interface.

| Meson patch | Decision and reason |
| --- | --- |
| `compilers_detect.py` | Retain only `cython-3.14`; upstream already supplies stdin language, so drop the suffix heuristics. |
| `compilers_mixins_gnu.py` | Retain conditional SunOS as-needed handling. |
| `dependencies_dev.py` | Explicit LLVM config-tool selection fails closed and cannot fall back through CMake. |
| `linkers_linkers.py` | Retain SunOS thin-archive restriction; drop unconditional rpath-link override. |
| `modules_pkgconfig.py` | Retain foreign pkg-config directory placement. |
| `scripts_depfixer.py` | Drop NetBSD ELF-fixup bypass; retain upstream install RPATH processing. |

Machine-file `llvm-config` entries retain upstream precedence over the
`LLVM_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable, including failure. Without a
machine entry, an explicit environment path must be absolute and must meet
the requested version. Missing, invalid or wrong-version tools cannot fall
back to suffixed/default tools or CMake. Native/build-machine selection may
use that environment path; a cross target uses its own machine file and
never imports the native environment selection. With no explicit selection,
upstream automatic dependency discovery remains available.

## Reproducible source checks

Save original archives in a private directory, using the URLs in sources.tsv.
The source check requires a C/C++ compiler, Python >=3.10 to run upstream
Meson, and an OpenSSL implementation with BLAKE2s support. Set `PYTHON`,
`CC`, `CXX`, `OPENSSL` or `BMAKE` explicitly when necessary.

```sh
sh profiles/common-build-tools/tests/source-profile.sh \
    /absolute/verified-distfiles /absolute/new-source-check
```

The test verifies archives and all 19 patches through actual pkgsrc
`checksum.awk`, rejects corrupted archives, unfiltered patch hashes,
missing patches and repeated application, and applies the full series
forward with zero fuzz. It checks PLIST additions and restored upstream
ELF fixup, exports exact recipes, compares unchanged GCC recipe composition,
and rejects existing destinations and unknown profiles. Logs and extracted
sources remain in the private output directory.

The named `llvm-source` third argument checks the LLVM family, metadata,
Clang command traces and upstream lit, while comparing unchanged common
recipes. Its source/native boundaries are documented in [llvm-family.md](llvm-family.md).

The named `python-source` third argument limits a follow-up to Python archive,
eight-patch series, negative checksum/application cases, source invariants and
exact exported recipe. It explicitly excludes unchanged Meson/GCC/native
contracts from its result; omitted tests are not counted as passed.

Actual Meson CLI fixtures exercise C++20 through a compiler proxy and ten
LLVM selection cases. Fake LLVM metadata proves tool choice/error handling;
it does not prove LLVM headers, libraries, ELF linkage or execution.
`MESON_SELECTION_CASE=missing` isolates the causal baseline: the original
pkgsrc patch accepts a missing path using `llvm-config-64`; the new patch
refuses it. The fixture preserves the actual configure statuses.

`tests/python-selection.sh EXPORTED_PKGSRC NEW_WORK` parses the actual
pkgsrc selection block with BSD make. It checks default 314, rejected old
CLI selection and unsupported/incompatible consumers. If BSD make is absent,
the source check prints an explicit SKIP. Native NetBSD BSD make has passed
the five selection cases; full package parsing/builds remain required.

The faulthandler compile gate is independently usable by a native parent:

```sh
CC=/absolute/current-cc sh profiles/common-build-tools/tests/faulthandler-macro.sh \
    /absolute/fully-patched-python /absolute/pristine-python /absolute/new-macro-check
```

It extracts the actual record/handler array and upstream count initializer,
includes the patched production pymacro header, covers optional SIGBUS/SIGILL
combinations with both actual HAVE_SIGACTION layouts, and requires pointer
misuse to fail compilation. The signal typedefs are extracted from upstream;
only the declaration-only visibility macro for unrelated prototypes is supplied.
Host builds select the NetBSD
macro branch after their system headers; they are not NetBSD execution proof.
The sole suppressed warning covers intentionally omitted trailing record
fields, as in the production initializer. Native GCC16 passed all eight
variants and pointer rejection, allowing removal of the manual count.
LLVM23 should check the same contract. See [native evidence](native-evidence.md)
for the bounded result; this is not a native Python package acceptance.

## Native acceptance still required

Use staged packages and normal pkgsrc checks; do not bypass missing files,
WRKREF, RPATH, checksum, dependency or upstream test failures.

- Meson: remaining upstream groups, explicit native/cross selection against
  installed LLVM23 and a shared-library fixture with transitive PREFIX dependencies.
  Installed C/C++ consumers, basic install-RPATH and the focused upstream group
  are [accepted in the AArch64 VM](cross/validation.md).
- Common consumers: current setuptools/wheel/Cython dependencies and LLVM23
  generators. Installed Mesa26 passes the graphics profile's package/runtime
  checks; desktop consumer migration remains in that profile.

Native libpython and all C++ consumers must use the selected common runtimes.
Source/host checks do not establish those package, ELF or Mesa gates.
