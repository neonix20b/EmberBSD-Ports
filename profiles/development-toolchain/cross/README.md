# GCC16 cross compiler for AArch64 EmberBSD

Cross-compilation is the preferred build path: build GCC 16.2.0 on the
development host and execute the resulting programs on EmberBSD. The tested
host is Apple Silicon macOS. There is no NetBSD-host
check in the compiler build or compile-only acceptance scripts. The separate
target runner requires AArch64 NetBSD because it executes target ELF files.

The compiler uses the same verified original GCC archive and frontend
portability patches as the Ports native package, including the nb1 C++
modules repair. This is a compiler build, not a cross-built pkgsrc package
or a complete distribution image. The target GCC16 runtime is taken from
an accepted sysroot; it is not rebuilt or installed by this recipe.

## Inputs

Prepare the development-toolchain or common-tools pkgsrc export using
[the parent profile](../README.md). Record the Ports commit and the sysroot's
source/package revisions and checksums. The archive URL and SHA256 are in
[the shared source manifest](../sources.tsv). Keep binary inputs outside Git.

Provide these absolute paths without whitespace:

1. The prepared pkgsrc tree containing `lang/gcc16` and the modules repair.
2. The original `gcc-16.2.0.tar.xz` archive.
3. An AArch64 EmberBSD sysroot with `/usr/include`, startup objects, libc,
   pthread and math libraries, loader, and the selected `/usr/pkg/gcc16`
   headers/runtime. Preserve relative symlinks. Resolve links escaping the
   sysroot when creating the snapshot; never resolve them against the host.
4. A host `TOOLDIR` produced by the fork's
   [cross-build path](https://github.com/oxtech-ember/EmberBSD/blob/main/ember/boot/cross-build.md).
   GNU make builds the compiler, and its AArch64 binutils are copied into the
   compiler prefix. Qualifying current binutils remains separate work.
5. A new work directory with room for sources, objects and the compiler.

Use native compilation only for stages whose missing cross support is
identified explicitly; port those stages through Ports. The compiler and
linker must run on the build host. The sysroot libraries
and startup objects must belong to the target. Equal CPU architecture does
not make Darwin and NetBSD executables interchangeable.

```sh
HOST_CC=cc HOST_CXX=c++ \
    sh profiles/development-toolchain/cross/build.sh \
    /absolute/pkgsrc /absolute/gcc-16.2.0.tar.xz /absolute/sysroot \
    /absolute/os-build/tools /absolute/new-gcc-cross
```

The five-argument command builds GMP 6.3.0, MPFR 4.2.2 and MPC 1.4.1 under
`NEW_WORK/host-math`. It downloads missing pinned archives into
`NEW_WORK/host-archives`. `EMBER_HOST_MATH_ARCHIVES` can name an existing cache
containing `gmp-6.3.0.tar.xz`, `mpfr-4.2.2.tar.bz2` and `mpc-1.4.1.tar.xz`.
Original URLs and SHA256 are in [host sources](host-sources.tsv) and the
[shared manifest](../sources.tsv).

For reuse, `host-math.sh ARCHIVE_DIRECTORY NETBSD_TOOLDIR NEW_WORK` prepares
the libraries separately. Pass its `NEW_WORK/prefix` through
`EMBER_HOST_MATH_PREFIX`, or as an optional argument immediately before the
compiler's `NEW_WORK`. Do not reuse the fork's old GMP 6.2.1 host library.
The helper verifies every archive before extraction, builds static libraries,
and runs their upstream test suites. It also checks long GMP loops with and
without signal delivery. Nothing is installed into a shared prefix. The GCC
recipe verifies the selected library versions and reruns this host contract before
compiler configuration. It records hashes of the three static libraries.

GMP 6.2.1 uses the reserved Darwin `x18` register in ARM64 assembly. During a
LiteRT build this caused intermittent compiler crashes in GMP/MPFR constant
evaluation. The compiler's attempt to print a backtrace then failed in Apple
libunwind. [Upstream identifies the ABI defect](https://gmplib.org/#STATUS);
[the register repair](https://gmplib.org/list-archives/gmp-commit/2020-November/003062.html)
is included in GMP 6.3.0. Updating the host library fixes the prerequisite;
compiler retries and lower job counts are not used as a substitute.

The recipe verifies the GCC SHA256 and recorded RCS-filtered patch hashes
before extraction. It applies the source patches with zero fuzz. As in the
native common profile, Graphite/ISL is disabled. The source archive does not
contain ISL; its unused distinfo entry is excluded explicitly.

One additional cross-only difference is necessary: `patch-gcc_Makefile.in`
is verified but not applied. That native pkgsrc patch embeds the compiler's
installation prefix as target runtime search paths. On macOS that would
leak a Mac path into the ELF link or fail linking outright. The cross build
retains upstream's default driver search logic. The acceptance recipe
selects the target GCC16 startup objects, headers and runtime explicitly.
This does not remove the RPATH repair from native packages.

The recipe installs into `new-gcc-cross/toolchain` and records inputs and
build logs in the work directory. It never writes `/usr/bin`, `/usr/pkg`,
`/etc/mk.conf` or a board. Keep the work directory and sysroot at their
recorded paths. `HOST_CC`/`HOST_CXX` name the existing host compilers;
`CROSS_JOBS` optionally overrides concurrency. Both recipes default to the
host's online CPU count from `getconf`, with `sysctl` as a fallback.
A failed stage returns nonzero.

The installed prefix includes GCC's `aarch64--netbsd/bin` tool-search
directory. This is required for the driver's `-gsplit-dwarf` invocation of
`objcopy`, even when ordinary compilation already works. The build runs
`tests/split-dwarf.sh CROSS_PREFIX NEW_WORK` with a clean PATH and no
`-B` or compiler-search overrides. The resulting DWARF5 skeleton and DWO
must both be readable and retain the named type. This contract passed on
2026-10-08 with the current GMP-backed GCC16 prefix.

## Compile here, execute on EmberBSD

```sh
sh profiles/development-toolchain/cross/compile-tests.sh \
    /absolute/new-gcc-cross/toolchain /absolute/sysroot /absolute/new-tests
```

This reuses the native C11 atomics/TLS and C++20 DSO test sources. It compiles
C with and without LTO, and C++ with threads, TLS, strings and exceptions
crossing a shared-library boundary. A floating constant-evaluation regression
includes `_Float32` limits and target long-double exponentiation.
It checks dynamic dependencies for host
path leakage. Compilation alone is not runtime acceptance.

Copy the complete `new-tests` directory to a scratch directory on the target,
then run:

```sh
sh /absolute/target-tests/run-target.sh /absolute/target-tests
```

For archives made on macOS, use `COPYFILE_DISABLE=1 tar --no-xattrs --no-acls
--no-fflags ...` so NetBSD tar does not fail restoring Apple metadata.
The target runner checks actual loaded `libstdc++` and `libgcc_s` identities
against the already installed `/usr/pkg/gcc16` compiler. Loader overrides
are rejected. It does not install packages or change login defaults.

## Validation boundary

On 2026-10-07, the rebuilt GCC 16.2.0 passed host compilation and target
acceptance with GMP 6.3.0, MPFR 4.2.2 and MPC 1.4.1. That build explicitly used
four jobs; the recipe's current default uses the detected host CPU count.
GMP's upstream test groups
had no failures. MPFR passed 195 tests with three skips; MPC passed all 75.
The reserved-register regression established the following on Apple Silicon:

| Host arithmetic implementation | Long-loop contract |
| --- | --- |
| Original GMP 6.2.1 ARM64 assembly | Four of four executions faulted |
| Same library with generic upstream `add_n` | Four of four passed |
| Same native `add_n`, only `x18` changed to `x17` | Six of six passed |
| GMP 6.3.0 | Passed with and without periodic signals |

The new static GMP archive contains no instructions using `x18`. The rebuilt
compiler passes the floating constant regression and the original protobuf
and RE2 compilation commands that exposed the failures.

The cross C11/C++20 contracts passed on physical Orange Pi Zero 3W (Allwinner
A733), NetBSD 11.0/AArch64, at 20:46 UTC on 2026-10-07. Execution took 0.18 s.
The DSO contract confirmed actual loading of `/usr/pkg/gcc16/lib/libstdc++.so.7`
and `/usr/pkg/gcc16/lib/libgcc_s.so.1` from the existing GCC16 nb1 runtime.
The board's firmware and hardware revision were not requalified by this test.
This covers the focused source scenarios, not the full upstream compiler
suite, arbitrary Ports packages, a full GCC16-built OS or GPU acceleration.

The common `mk.conf` still describes the **installed native compiler** policy.
Do not feed a target `/usr/pkg/gcc16/bin/gcc` to a Darwin build process.
General pkgsrc cross-package orchestration and Canadian-cross building of
an installable target GCC package require separate build/host/target handling.
The standalone cross compiler here is immediately usable for target source
compilation; its availability does not establish those package workflows.
