Upstream is MIT licensed, copyright 2021 Lars Berscheid. Its complete notice
is installed as `share/ember-ruckig/licenses/Ruckig-MIT`. No source or algorithm
patch is applied. Cloud client, examples, benchmarks and Python bindings are
disabled through upstream options. The C++20 shared library retains its
upstream package export; this profile does not promise a stable ABI across
different Ruckig releases.

The recipes and independent C++ contracts are original MIT-licensed EmberBSD
work developed with AI assistance. Builder structure follows the existing
Fusion profile. No changes have been sent to or accepted by upstream.
Fixtures use analytic jerk-limited motion and original synthetic inputs.
