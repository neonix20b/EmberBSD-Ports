# Xfce on EmberBSD

This source probe provides the stable Xfce 4.20 desktop: xfwm4 window
management, a panel, desktop icons, settings, session management, Thunar
file browsing and the application finder. Mousepad 0.7.0 adds a GTK3 text
editor. Ports owns the recipe; [PROVENANCE.md](PROVENANCE.md) records
versions, original source URLs and the limits of the profile.

All components install into one private prefix. The recipe preserves
the active desktop and does not register a login session. Source
preparation alone is not evidence that the desktop runs on EmberBSD.
The complete X11 application workflow now passes on NetBSD 11/AArch64
in UTM; [native validation](VALIDATION.md) records the scope and boundaries.

## Requirements

Use NetBSD/EmberBSD development and X11 sets with the following existing
pkgsrc development libraries and tools:

- GTK3, GLib/GIO, Pango/Cairo, GdkPixbuf, libdisplay-info, libxklavier,
  libnotify, startup-notification, libcanberra, libexif and libpng.
- X11, Xft, Xinerama, RandR, Xcursor, XRes, XPresent, XComposite, XFixes,
  XDamage, Xrender, XI, SM and ICE from the base X11 set or shared pkgsrc.
- GNU make, Meson, Ninja, pkg-config, gettext tools, xsltproc, Perl,
  `gdbus-codegen`, GLib resource/marshalling tools, `sha256`, `tar` and
  a native C/C++ compiler. Curl is only needed without an archive cache.
- Python 3 for upstream Meson/GLib/Xfce generators. The builder uses
  `/usr/pkg/bin/python3.13` by default, overridable with `PYTHON`.
  It does not install another interpreter. No new EmberBSD helper uses Python.
- GtkSourceView 4 for Mousepad; set `BUILD_MOUSEPAD=0` to omit the editor.
  A D-Bus session bus, X11 utilities, fonts and icon themes are needed at
  runtime. A minimal clean-machine dependency installation is unverified.

The validated NetBSD 11/aarch64 VM uses the GCC 16.2.0 candidate for this
build, GTK3 3.24.52, GLib 2.88.1 and Perl 5.44.0. The recipe supplies
libwnck, libyaml and Xfce development tools from selected source releases. Existing
matching libwnck/libyaml versions are reused; a version conflict stops
the build instead of installing a parallel copy.

No binary package operation is part of this recipe. Do not satisfy its
dependencies by downgrading the common Perl, gettext or other installed
tools. `intltool` is not required by these release configure scripts.
Meson and the small Xfce development-tools package provide the generators.

## Build

Run as an ordinary user from this directory:

```sh
mkdir -p "$HOME/.cache"
JOBS=1 sh build.sh "$HOME/.cache/emberbsd-xfce"
```

The work path must be absolute, new, have an existing writable parent,
and contain only letters, digits, `_`, `.`, `/` and `-`. A second argument
accepts a directory containing the original archives from
[sources.tsv](sources.tsv). Every archive is checked before extraction.
`CC` and `CXX` accept executable paths; `CFLAGS`, `CXXFLAGS`, `CPPFLAGS`
and `LDFLAGS` allow compiler flags. The compiler defaults are
`/usr/pkg/gcc16/bin/gcc` and `/usr/pkg/gcc16/bin/g++`; the recipe does not
silently fall back to the base compiler. The default is `JOBS=1`.

The same recipe supports limited build windows or repeating a failed
component without rebuilding successful dependencies:

```sh
sh prepare-sources.sh "$HOME/.cache/emberbsd-xfce" /path/to/archives
JOBS=1 sh build-component.sh "$HOME/.cache/emberbsd-xfce" libwnck
JOBS=1 sh build-component.sh "$HOME/.cache/emberbsd-xfce" yaml
# Continue with component names in the first column of sources.tsv, in order.
```

`build.sh` performs both phases; do not run it on an already prepared
directory. The per-component builder can repeat a component after a
failure. Logs, sources, build directories and installs remain below the
work path. The YAML parser's upstream `make check` runs after its build.
Do not claim application support from configuration or compilation alone.
The session's `--with-xsession-prefix` explicitly uses the private prefix;
upstream otherwise installs its display-manager entry under `/usr`,
independently of `--prefix`.

## Profile and session boundary

The profile explicitly selects X11. Wayland, Polkit integration,
libxfce4ui's optional hardware inventory, Thunar's GUdev auto-mounting,
settings' colord/UPower integration and panel DBusMenu integration are
disabled. The panel still supplies its normal application menu, task
list, pager and launchers; application-specific indicator menus need
separate validation. Introspection and Vala bindings are omitted.

xfwm4 includes its X11 compositor, but acceleration is not established.
Use a separate software-rendered X11 server for validation. The session
launcher must keep the real HOME and provide private XDG configuration,
cache, data and runtime directories,
a private D-Bus session bus, this prefix's `bin` in PATH, and
`XDG_CONFIG_DIRS=PREFIX/etc/xdg`. Put `PREFIX/share` before `/usr/pkg/share`
in `XDG_DATA_DIRS`, and put `PREFIX/lib` first in `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
Do not inherit `SESSION_MANAGER` or the active desktop's D-Bus address.
Use [the session policy](SESSION.md) and `prepare-session.sh` to select
supported kiosk/settings restrictions and prevent unrelated autostart.

Use `xfce4-session` inside the isolated server. Exercise its panel/menu,
Thunar, Mousepad save/reopen, window movement/focus and session exit.
Capture the running versions and actual library resolutions. Check that
no `libintl.so.8` is loaded alongside native `libintl.so.1`. Record VM
and board results separately. Hardware power control, suspend, screen
locking, touch and a display-manager login session remain outside this
profile's validation boundary.

Run the complete check after building:

```sh
sh ../x11-desktops/test-runtime.sh xfce /absolute/xfce/install /absolute/xfce-runtime
```

Besides the shared WM/terminal checks, it verifies Thunar directory
navigation, Mousepad save/quit/reopen/edit, and a real terminal launched
through the panel menu and Application Finder. The controller checks exact
saved bytes and normal session exit. [SESSION.md](SESSION.md) explains
the private configuration and excluded system actions.

## Installed C library check

After installing libwnck, run its small native C consumer outside a desktop
session and without loader overrides:

```sh
sh tests/check-libwnck.sh /absolute/xfce/install /absolute/new-wnck-check
```

The check uses the installed GCC 16 candidate by default (`CC` overrides
its executable path). It exercises libwnck's actual GObject API, records
the loaded DSOs, verifies the selected prefix, and rejects duplicate GCC
or C++ runtime families. It needs no X server. This narrow C API result
does not accept the common C++ runtime migration: existing GTK dependencies
can still pull in the base runtime. The executable's RPATH alone does not
prove which transitive libraries were loaded.
