# Mesa 26.2.4 patch inventory

The selected common source is [Mesa 26.2.4](https://docs.mesa3d.org/relnotes/26.2.4.html).
The four local patches are AI-assisted, not submitted upstream. Mesa source
licenses remain unchanged; new utility code is MIT and probe tests are
BSD-2-Clause. The archive URL and SHA256 are in [sources.tsv](sources.tsv).

## Current adaptations

- `patch-dso-lifetime` binds callbacks to the owning ELF DSO on NetBSD.
  Plain NetBSD `atexit` records no DSO owner. The helper uses `__cxa_atexit`
  with a typed trampoline and hidden local handle; it propagates allocation
  and registration failure and frees failed registrations. Other systems
  retain plain `atexit`. The implementation preserves reverse registration
  order across C++ destructors and C callbacks. It replaces the old
  unconditional `HAVE_NOATEXIT` destructor strategy.
- `patch-src_util_half__float.c` normalizes binary16 subnormals using integers,
  avoiding a binary32 subnormal intermediate flushed by the caller FP state.
- `patch-include_c99__alloca.h` selects compiler stack allocation on NetBSD
  in strict C11/C++17 modes. The libc declaration otherwise becomes an
  unresolved external call. No allocation shim or GNU dialect is introduced.
- `patch-bin_symbols-check.py` extends the existing upstream ELF bookkeeping
  allowlist to NetBSD without relaxing extra/missing API checks. Meson passes
  its target system explicitly, so a macOS host checks NetBSD ELF correctly.
  Direct native invocation retains the host default. The cross regression
  uses actual AArch64 ELF and native Mach-O libraries, including extra and
  missing export failures.

The lifetime patch covers all 13 registration sites in the selected source:
EGL, GLX, context, formats, extensions, options cache, locale, process name,
util queues, trace output, driver trace, optional Perfetto and ORC JIT.
Perfetto is disabled in this recipe but its cleanup remains adapted. All
remaining plain callbacks are in unselected physical Vulkan drivers or tools;
`tools=`, `vulkan-drivers=` and `vulkan-layers=` keep them outside this profile.
Native complete EGL/GLX/GBM/llvmpipe lifecycle checks still gate promotion.
The queue fixture tests callback dependencies; it does not replace the actual
Mesa queue or EGL integration tests. Its executable links pthread at startup:
NetBSD cannot initialize threading by loading libpthread late through a plugin.
Check this same constraint in dynamically loaded real graphics consumers.

The symbol policy also has a macOS cross check using the prepared compiler
and an existing Python interpreter. It builds small real target ELF and
native Mach-O libraries, then verifies target selection and export failures:

```sh
PYTHON=/absolute/python3.14 sh tests/mesa-symbols-cross.sh \
    PATCHED_MESA CROSS_GCC16_PREFIX TARGET_SYSROOT NEW_WORK
```

`tests/mesa-alloca.sh` takes the same four path arguments. It reconstructs
the unpatched header and requires both strict-mode links to fail, then
builds the patched C11/C++17 fixtures without an external `alloca` reference.
Run both outputs on the target with zero and several arguments to check
dynamic length, alignment, guard bytes and storage across another stack call.

## Disposition of all 44 previous patches

The former Mesa 21.3.9 set came from
[pkgsrc 0491f5e57e8fba00998bf1a6c0958ef421fefaa1](https://github.com/NetBSD/pkgsrc/tree/0491f5e57e8fba00998bf1a6c0958ef421fefaa1/graphics/MesaLib/patches),
plus three local fixes. Removing a patch is not a claim of upstream acceptance.
Identifiers below preserve the imported revision and authorship. Git retains
the original imported bytes and the superseded probe for comparison.

## Version and ABI boundaries

GCC 16.2.0 and common LLVM 23.1.2, Meson 1.12.1 and Python 3.14.8 are
required without older-library fallback. We select ORC JIT for the current
LLVM path; upstream AArch64 can still choose MCJIT. ORC JIT, llvmpipe, softpipe
and classic VirGL remain enabled together. Vulkan, video frontends, Rusticl,
physical-driver tools and GLVND are outside this initial probe.
Mesa 26 installs `libgallium-26.2.4.so`; shared libglapi is no longer installed.
Do not emulate its old SONAME with symlinks. Audit and rebuild Qt/GNOME/Xorg
consumers against the common ABI before package promotion. The
[temporary headless cross diagnostic](../../profiles/common-graphics/cross/README.md)
has separate softpipe board evidence; it does not establish the complete
shared-LLVM23 package or X11/Wayland renderer acceptance.

The 2026-10-06 native ABI inventory found Qt6Gui 6.11.1 depends on base
libEGL.so.0/libGL.so.3/libstdc++.so.9, while Mutter 40.2 and COGL depend on
libEGL.so.0. Base EGL/GL/GBM require libglapi.so.1 and libdrm.so.3. The selected
non-GLVND Mesa source instead declares libEGL.so.1/libGL.so.1 and libgallium;
these are concrete consumer rebuild requirements. Startup pthread linkage
is also required for clients that load worker-using libraries dynamically.
